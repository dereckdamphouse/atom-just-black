Feel free to report an issue or leave any suggestions on [Github](https://github.com/dereckdamphouse/atom-just-black)!

## Note
If you are seeing very different colors, you may need to wait for VSCode to release an update. In the meantime, make sure to set the following setting:

```
"editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false
```
